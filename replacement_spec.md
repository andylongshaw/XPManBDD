# requirements

If you have not received an order, you can submit an undelivered order notification.
If this is your first claim, then a replacement order is created. If you have made a
claim before, your claim case is opened and assigned to a customer service representative
who will investigate the claim. In all cases, a lost mail compensation case is opened
and sent to the courier with details of the consignment that as undelivered.

This might result in more than one feature. The first might be a [customer requests a
replacement order](replacement.feature) feature, but others might look at what happens to the claim case and lost mail compensation case.
